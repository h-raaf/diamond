Now you lay before me, defeated. \n\n  You hold into the organization, your clan, one’s name… But these are thing that limit us and our capacities, and we should detach ourselves from such trivial thing! Also, it is foolish to fear what we’ve yet to see or comprehend! \n\n  I have lost all hope for this pathetic clan. \n\n * Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature... They are the strong ones! \n\n * People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define ‘reality’. But what does it mean to be ‘correct’ or ‘true’? Merely vague concepts... Their ‘reality’ may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs? \n\n * You focus on the trivial, and lose sight of what is most important, change is impossible in this fog of ignorance. \n\n * People's lives don't end when they die. It ends when they lose faith. \n\n\n\n Anime: Naruto Shippudden ",
