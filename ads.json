	 "text": "If you’re currently logged into Huawei Health with an existing Huawei ID you’ll need to log out. Existing activity data on your current account will not be synced with Strava, it will only sync new data after you’ve paired Huawei Health with Strava natively. Open Huawei Health, tap the Me tab, tap your profile picture at the top, and tap the Log out button. If you’re using a Huawei phone you’ll also want to log out your Huawei ID in the phone’s Settings menu. \n\n  Next we want to wipe the data in Huawei Health. Go to Apps in your phone’s Settings menu, Force Stop Huawei Health, and clear the cache and data for Huawei Health. \n\n  Turn on airplane mode. This stops Huawei Health from automatically signing you back into your existing Huawei ID. Factory reset your wearable. \n\n  Launch Huawei Health. You should have the option to choose your country at the top. Select a country that has native support for Strava already (e.g. Singapore). Tap Next. \n\n  Tap Agree on the next screen. You should now be on the main Huawei Health dashboard screen.  \n\n  Disable airplane mode on your phone and wait for the internet to reconnect. Tap the Me tab in Huawei Health and then Log in with Huawei ID at the top of the screen. You don’t want to sign in with any pre-existing credentials. You want to create a new account by tapping the Register button. \n\n  On the next screen ensure Singapore (or whichever Strava-supporting country you chose earlier) is selected as your region and tap Next. Enter your date of birth and tap Next. \n\n  You’ll now see two options: Use phone number and Use email address. Register your new Huawei ID using either an email address or telephone number not already associated with a Huawei ID. I opted for email address. \n\n  Create a password for your new Huawei ID. \n\n  Enter a security phone number or email. This is just to receive a code, so it should be a phone number/email you actually have access to (it doesn’t have to be from the country you chose). If you don’t have a spare phone number you can use a friend’s number or a web service that allows you to receive messages online from a spoof phone number. \n\n  Enter the verification code and tap Finish. \n\n  Verify your email address by opening the email sent to you and tapping Verify. You can now go back to Huawei Health and tap Verified. \n\n  You should now be logged into Huawei Health with your new Huawei ID. \n\n  If you want your heart rate data to be synced to Strava you’ll first need to allow the heart-rate data permission in the Strava app before connecting Huawei Health to it. Go to the Strava app, tap the Settings icon in the top right and tap Data permissions. Tap Health-related data and tap Allow to grant access. \n\n  Go back to Huawei Health. Go to the Me tab and tap Privacy management. Scroll down and tap Data sharing and authorization. You should now see Strava as an option. Tap it. \n\n  Tap Connect with Strava. Sign into your Strava account. Tap Authorize on the next screen to connect Huawei Health with Strava. You should see a success message. \n\n  Pair your Huawei wearable to your phone with your new Huawei Health account. \n\n  The next time you track an activity on your Huawei wearable it will be synced automatically with Strava. If it doesn’t appear straight away, ensure the activity has been synced with Huawei Health first and then swipe down on the Strava home screen to refresh. ",
