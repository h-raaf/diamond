        "text": " ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot developed by OpenAI based on GPT-3.5. It has a remarkable ability to interact in conversational dialogue form and provide responses that can appear surprisingly human. \n\n Large language models perform the task of predicting the next word in a series of words. \n\n Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is an additional layer of training that uses human feedback to help ChatGPT learn the ability to follow directions and generate responses that are satisfactory to humans.",

        "text": "  ChatGPT was trained using a mix of machine learning and human intervention, using a method called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). \n\n  In fact, the first stage of training involved humans playing the role of both a human user and an AI assistant having a conversation. This helped to demonstrate responses that are preferred by humans and go towards building a large dataset to feed the model. \n\n  Next, a reward model needed to be created for reinforcement learning. To do this, human AI trainers once again stepped in, but this time they were asked to rank several model answers by quality, further helping ChatGPT choose the best response. \n\n  All of this is to say, humans had a hand in helping to train ChatGPT so that its answers are not only factually accurate but written in a natural, human-like way. From AI voice generators to AI writing tools, it's clear that the future will be shaped by these powerful machine learning tools. \n\n  Another important point to remember is that ChatGPT doesn't always provide factually correct answers, and it can produce biased content too. This technology is still in development and isn't yet foolproof.",

        "text": " The ChatGPT webpage is simple and includes an area for the results to populate and a text box at the bottom of the page for you to type your inquiries. We started with questions; however, OpenAI recommends inputting a statement for the best possible result. \n\n  For example, inputting “explain how the solar system was made” will give a more detailed result with more paragraphs than “how was the solar system made,” even though both inquiries will give fairly detailed results. You also have the option to get more specific inputting requests for an essay with a specific number of paragraphs or a Wikipedia page. We got an extremely detailed result, with the request “write a four-paragraph essay explaining Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.” \n\n  If there is enough information available, the generator will fulfill the commands with accurate details. Otherwise, there is potential for ChatGPT to begin filling in gaps with incorrect data. OpenAI notes that these instances are rare. The brand also notes that ChatGPT also currently has “limited knowledge of world events after 2021.” \n\n  Even so, you have the option to input queries continuously until you close your browser or reset the thread to clear your previous requests. You also have the option to use ChatGPT in dark mode or light mode. \n\n  You can access the OpenAI Discord server and blog from this webpage and log out from there.",
